## 🎯 Problem Statement
The modern educational system is heavily burdened by inefficiencies in **paper-based learning and assessment**.  

### 1. Traditional Assessment Limitations  
- ⏳ **Time-Intensive Grading**: Educators spend hours marking assignments, reducing time for teaching.  
- ⚖️ **Scalability Issues**: Manual systems cannot handle large student populations.  
- ⌛ **Delayed Feedback**: Students receive generic responses instead of tailored guidance.  

### 2. Digital-Physical Divide  
- 📖 **Fragmented Learning Resources**: Handwritten notes, textbooks, and digital materials remain disconnected.  
- 🚪 **Accessibility Barriers**: Students with disabilities and remote learners struggle with paper-only methods.  
- 🔍 **No Searchability**: Physical documents lack search and indexing capabilities.  

### 3. Complex Assessment Challenges  
- 🎨 **Visual Content**: Flowcharts, equations, and technical diagrams are hard to grade manually.  
- ⚠️ **Consistency Issues**: Human graders differ in evaluation standards.  
- 🌍 **Language Barriers**: Multilingual classrooms add complexity to both teaching and grading.
